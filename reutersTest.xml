        <BODY>President Reagan said a further file
            decline in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive.
            In written answers to questions put by Japan's Asahi
            Shimbun newspaper, he noted Treasury Secretary James Baker had
            said all seven major industrial nations were committed to
            cooperating in fostering stability of exchange rates.
            "We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be
            counterproductive," Reagan said. sumita
            Reagan said the best way for the United States to reduce
            its trade deficit was to export more.
            He said Japan could make a major contribution to reducing
            external imbalances and sustaining world economic growth by
            adopting policies to promote stronger domestic demand in the
            short-run and, in the long-run, implementing structural reforms
            to ease Japanese dependence on exports as a source of growth.

            the recent rapid rise of the Tokyo stock and yen bond markets

            In a statement to the bank's regional branch managers, sumita
            Sumita said the central bank was particularly monitoring the
            markets because of the recent rapid growth of money supply. He
            said he is also carefully watching real estate prices.
            Sumita said he expects money supply growth to remain high
            from April through June. In March, money supply, as measured by
            M-2 plus certificates of deposit, rose at a year-on-year rate
            of nine pct.

<BODY>Showers continued throughout the week in
the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early
January and improving prospects for the coming temporao,
although normal humidity levels have not been restored,
Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.
    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.
    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags
of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93
mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems
that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the
arrivals figures.
    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how
much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has
practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates
around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there
are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.
    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit
for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in
obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.
    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have
sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.
    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350
cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.
    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and
only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to
1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.
    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with
June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs
under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs
per tonne FOB.
    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.
    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July
at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at
2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and
2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,
Uruguay and open ports.
    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times
New York Dec for Oct/Dec.
    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible
currency areas.
    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325
and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New
York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York
Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith
said.
    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags
against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.
    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to
be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after
carnival which ends midday on February 27.

<BODY>BankAmerica Corp is not under
pressure to act quickly on its proposed equity offering and
would do well to delay it because of the stock's recent poor
performance, banking analysts said.
    Some analysts said they have recommended BankAmerica delay
its up to one-billion-dlr equity offering, which has yet to be
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
    BankAmerica stock fell this week, along with other banking
issues, on the news that Brazil has suspended interest payments
on a large portion of its foreign debt.
    The stock traded around 12, down 1/8, this afternoon,
after falling to 11-1/2 earlier this week on the news.
    Banking analysts said that with the immediate threat of the
First Interstate Bancorp &lt;I> takeover bid gone, BankAmerica is
under no pressure to sell the securities into a market that
will be nervous on bank stocks in the near term.
    BankAmerica filed the offer on January 26. It was seen as
one of the major factors leading the First Interstate
withdrawing its takeover bid on February 9.
    A BankAmerica spokesman said SEC approval is taking longer
than expected and market conditions must now be re-evaluated.
    "The circumstances at the time will determine what we do,"
said Arthur Miller, BankAmerica's Vice President for Financial
Communications, when asked if BankAmerica would proceed with
the offer immediately after it receives SEC approval.
    "I'd put it off as long as they conceivably could," said
Lawrence Cohn, analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith.
    Cohn said the longer BankAmerica waits, the longer they
have to show the market an improved financial outlook.
    Although BankAmerica has yet to specify the types of
equities it would offer, most analysts believed a convertible
preferred stock would encompass at least part of it.
    Such an offering at a depressed stock price would mean a
lower conversion price and more dilution to BankAmerica stock
holders, noted Daniel Williams, analyst with Sutro Group.
    Several analysts said that while they believe the Brazilian
debt problem will continue to hang over the banking industry
through the quarter, the initial shock reaction is likely to
ease over the coming weeks.
    Nevertheless, BankAmerica, which holds about 2.70 billion
dlrs in Brazilian loans, stands to lose 15-20 mln dlrs if the
interest rate is reduced on the debt, and as much as 200 mln
dlrs if Brazil pays no interest for a year, said Joseph
Arsenio, analyst with Birr, Wilson and Co.
    He noted, however, that any potential losses would not show
up in the current quarter.
    With other major banks standing to lose even more than
BankAmerica if Brazil fails to service its debt, the analysts
said they expect the debt will be restructured, similar to way
Mexico's debt was, minimizing losses to the creditor banks.

        <PLACES>japan</PLACES>
        <BODY>Japanese oil companies are starting miyazawa
            campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing
            domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sources
            said.
            Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this
            summer, starting with &lt;Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.
            Showa Shell Sekiyu KK &lt;SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell
            98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.
            Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a
            higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted
            other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.
            "We have received a good response from consumers of Formula
            Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel
            consumption," Showa Shell said.
            Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher
            than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share
            of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.
            High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total
            gasoline sales in Japan, it added.
            Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct
            of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately
            after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.
            Nippon Oil Co Ltd &lt;NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100
            octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high
            octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline
            sales.
            The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share
            has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift
            gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station
            construction in the next two to three years.
            "Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline
            sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline
            production quotas," an official at a major oil company said.
            An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade
            and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government
            press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including
            the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil
            companies increase their international competitiveness.
            Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil,
            Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the
            production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.
            Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct
            from the previous year, according to a MITI report.
